# Immersion Time Tracker

Tool to automatically track time you spend watching videos (immersing) on sites like YouTube, Netflix, etc.

## Features

In a future update the user will able to connect their Toggl Track account by sharing their API key, which would allow for the extension to automatically create time entries for them.
