# Immersion Time Tracker

Tool to automatically track time you spend watching videos (immersing) on sites like YouTube, Netflix, etc. (No more manual tracking with Toggl!)

## Installation

### Steps

1. Download the latest release as a .zip file. 
2. Extract to an empty folder.
3. Navigate to your Chrome extensions.
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right.
5. Press "Load unpacked" in the top left and select the downloaded .zip file.
6. Enjoy!

## Features

After installation, the extension will automatically detect when a video starts playing on supported websites, upon which it will create a video entry and store it in the local storage, allowing it to remember what videos you have watched. You will be able to see what you have recently watched (last hour), and will be able to navigate back to video links.

 In a future update the user will able to connect their Toggl Track account by sharing their API key, which would allow for the extension to automatically create time entries for them.

## Usage

Follow the instructions to install the extension. Click the extensions icon to reveal the tracker. You can pin the extension to the Chrome toolbar for easier access.

## Note

* Navigating away from a video before pausing will keep the timer going.
* Having multiple videos play at once will likely conflict and cause issues with the tracker.
