# Immersion Time Tracker

Tool to automatically track time you spend watching videos (immersing) on sites like YouTube, Netflix, etc. (No more manual tracking with Toggl!).

Works best for free-flow immersion. Support for active immersion, where the video is often paused for prolonged periods of time despite the user still immersing, will come in a future update.

## Installation

### Steps

1. Download the latest release as a .zip file. 
2. Unzip it in an empty directory of your choice.
3. Navigate to your Chrome extensions.
4. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right.
5. Press "Load unpacked" in the top left and select the directory.
6. Enjoy!

## Features

After installation, the extension will automatically detect when a video starts playing on supported websites, upon which it will create a video entry and store it in the local storage, allowing it to remember what videos you have watched. You will be able to see what you have recently watched (last hour), and will be able to navigate back to video links.

 In a future update the user will able to connect their Toggl Track account by sharing their API key, which would allow for the extension to automatically create time entries for them.
